Slide 2: Agenda

1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Advanced Feature Engineering
4. Key Insights & Summary

Slide 3: Day 1 – Data Cleaning

Key Points:

* Dataset loaded: `cleaned_playstore.csv`
* Missing values handled: `Rating`, `Type`, `Content Rating`, `Current Ver`, `Android Ver`
* Duplicates removed based on `App`
* Numeric columns cleaned: `Installs`, `Price`, `Reviews`
* App `Size` converted to MB
* Outliers removed: `Rating <= 5`, `Price >= 0`
* Added feature: `isPaid`

Visual Suggestion: Table with sample before/after cleaning

Slide 4: Dataset Overview

Key Stats:

* Total apps: *len(df)*
* Categories: *df['Category'].nunique()*
* Missing values handled
* Average Rating: ~ *df['Rating'].mean()*

Visual Suggestion: Bar chart of top 10 categories

Slide 5: App Categories & Ratings

* Most Popular Category: *{top_cats.index[0]}*
* Rating Distribution: Average rating: *{df['Rating'].mean():.2f}*
* Free vs Paid: Paid apps slightly higher ratings

Visuals:

* Bar chart: Top categories
* Histogram: Rating distribution
* Boxplot: Ratings by Free/Paid

Slide 6: Installs Analysis

* Top categories by total installs: Communication, Social, Tools
* Reviews ↔ Installs: Strong correlation

Visuals:

* Bar chart: Top 10 categories by installs
* Correlation heatmap: Rating, Reviews, Installs, Price, isPaid

Slide 7: Paid Apps Analysis

* Total paid apps: *len(paid_df)* (~*{len(paid_df)/len(df)*100:.1f}%*)
* Average price: ~$*{paid_df['Price'].mean():.2f}*
* Price < $50 distribution

Visual: Histogram of paid app prices

Slide 8: Feature Engineering

* Log transformation: `log_installs = np.log1p(Installs)`
* Rating categories: Low, Medium, High
* Pairplot: Key metrics colored by Paid/Free

Visuals:

* Histogram: log-transformed installs
* Bar chart: apps by rating category
* Pairplot: Ratings, Reviews, Installs, Price

Slide 9: Correlation Analysis

* Reviews ↔ Installs: Strongest correlation
* Price ↔ Rating: Weak correlation
* Log-transformed installs improve insight

Visual: Updated correlation heatmap

Slide 10: Final Insights

1. Category Insights: Communication & Social dominate
2. Rating Insights: Paid apps slightly higher rating
3. Install Insights: Reviews correlate with installs
4. Pricing Insights: Most paid apps < $50, weak correlation with rating
5. Feature Engineering: Log-transformed installs & rating categories

Visual Suggestion: Icons or small charts summarizing each point

Slide 11: Next Steps

* Upload cleaned dataset to Power BI
* Build dashboards: Categories, Ratings, Revenue potential
* Monitor app performance trends
